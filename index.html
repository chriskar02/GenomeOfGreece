          <p class="indent">The "GoGreece" initiative is a long-term National Genomics project, focused on the implementation of Genomic Medicine in Greece. 
            Officially launched in March 2010, the long-term aims and goals of the “Genome of Greece (GoGreece)” initiative is to:
            <li>Determine the allelic architecture of the Hellenic population, especially focusing on rare, pathogenic or not, variants that are characteristic for the Hellenic population,</li>
            <li>Characterize the unique allelic spectrum of isolate populations in Greece, such as the islands, mountainous regions, as well as population groups such as Greek Roma and Pomaks,</li>
            <li>Establish the pathogenic variant spectrum of common and rare genetic diseases in the Greek population,</li>
            <li>Develop and maintain a comprehensive knowledgebase documenting the extant genetic heterogeneity in the Greek population, as far as pathogenic variants and polymorphic alleles are concerned,</li>
            <li>Address important ethical, legal and societal issues pertaining to the implementation of Genomic Medicine interventions in Greece,</li>
            <li>Enhance the genomics education of healthcare professionals and biomedical scientists in Greece, and</li>
            <li>Raise genomics awareness of the general public.</li>

        <p class="indent">The experimental work that spans across the “GoGreece” initiative is multi-disciplinary, involving wet-lab,
           dry-lab and public health genomics activities all focused on the implementation and discovery work on genomic and personalised medicine in Greece. 
          In particular, the initiative is comprised of the following work packages:

        <h3>Next-generation sequencing</h3>
        <p class="indent">The core element of the “GoGreece” initiative is the sequence analysis of a large number of individuals from
           the Hellenic population using next-generation sequencing approaches, specifically by targeted resequencing and/or whole exome and/or whole genome sequencing.
            In particular, we aim to analyze:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A large number of healthy donors of Hellenic origin, to determine the allelic architecture of the population, especially the pharmacogenomic variants for
             population pharmacogenomics,</li>
          <li>Cohorts of patients, suffering from rare multifactorial genetic diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, celiac disease, multiple sclerosis, etc.,
             to identify the underlying genetic etiology,</li>
          <li>Cohorts of patients, suffering from monogenic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and β-thalassemia to identify genetic modifiers of the final clinical phenotype.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h3>Informatics tools and knowledgebase</h3>
        <p class="indent">We have developed and currently populating the Hellenic National genetic database to store the generated genomic data, in a de-identified manner to
           ensure patient and healthy donor data anonymity. This database is accompanied by a set of informatics tools that calculate the allelic frequencies in a dynamic manner
            and present them in an aggregated form to depict the cumulative allelic frequencies for the Hellenic population.</p>
        <p>Data deposition follows the microattribution concept to incentivize genomic data submission.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h3>Public engagement</h3>
        <p class="indent">Implementation of genomic medicine dictates the fine mapping of the stakeholders' environment. We have used structured questionnaires, face-to-face
           interviews and surveys to assess the opinion and standpoint of the various stakeholders in Greece, such as the Ministry of Health, National Medicines Organization,
            payers and insurance companies, biotechnologies and pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions and research institutes, clinicians
             (geneticists and other specialties), biomedical scientists, professional organisations, media and the press and religious organisations.</p>
        <p class="indent">Lasty, we have documented the existing genetic laboratories in Greece and, currently, this information is being compiled into a data repository to
           be directly accessible from the general public and clinicians.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h3>Genomics education and awareness</h3>
        <p class="indent">The “GoGreece” initiative is committed to raising genomics education and awareness of the Hellenic population, both the general public and
           healthcare professionals and biomedical scientists. Using questionnaires and surveys, we have first assessed the level of genomics awareness and genetic education
            of the general public and of healthcare professionals, respectively.</p>
        <p class="indent">Also, we have developed e-learning courses in the field of genomic medicine ensuring continuous medical education of interested healthcare professionals
           and biomedical scientists, while we have also established a mobile molecular biology laboratory (2MoBiL) aiming to familiarize primary and high school students
            and their teachers with the basic notions of genomic medicine. Lastly, since 2019, we are publishing a new Greek scientific journal
             Εξατομικευμένη Ιατρική (Personalized Medicine), the first in the fields of Human Genomics and Personalized Medicine, while as of 2019,
              we launched a same-themed annual conference series, aiming to become a focal point and the main forum for experimental and implementation
               work pertaining to Personalized Medicine in Greece.</p>
